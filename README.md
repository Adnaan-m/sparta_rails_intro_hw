# Sparta Rails Intro HW

This README document explains the use of Ruby-Rails. Praise the lord for ruby-rails! If you aren't sure what Ruby Rails is, it is the programming language to support server-side rendering. However, unlike vanilla Ruby, Ruby Rails does alot of the leg work for you providing quicker system creation as well as easy templating for the developer to ease the experience of creating specific functions in an accurate manner. This task displays the creation of a very basic website with little to no styling but focusing on the CRUD functionality of data from a Database using a front-end website application. 

### Languages used
* Ruby...on rails
* Postgres

### Challenges
1. The main challenge that was approached was the implementation of the syntax in accordance to the Ruby Rail way instead of the developers way. As alot of processing goes on in the background without the developer being able to see the results, it became apparent that the developer had less control in a sense as to what the system what doing. As a result the way forward was to code according to way Ruby Rails expected.
2. Although the task was successful, it would be said that developing a website further would be difficult to process and implicate. HOWEVER, practice makes perfect! 

### Learning points
Ruby Rails is very powerful but requires great knowledge and application to step by step processes with understanding of what is going on.
